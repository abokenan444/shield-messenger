## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Security Hardening v2 (2026-02-24)
- **Post-Quantum Ratchet — Out-of-Order Support**: Skipped-message key cache (up to 256 ahead) for reliable decryption of messages delivered out of order. Duplicate messages rejected. Keys zeroized after use.
- **Configurable Fixed Packet Size**: `set_fixed_packet_size(4096 | 8192 | 16384)` for runtime configuration. 8192/16384 recommended for voice/video.
- **Truncated Exponential Delays**: Replaced uniform random delay with truncated exponential distribution (lambda=0.005) for timing analysis resistance.
- **Cover Traffic**: `generate_cover_packet()` (type `0xFF`) sent every 30-90 seconds on idle connections. Receiver discards silently.
- **`ct_eq!` Macro**: Convenience constant-time equality macro for any byte expression. Added `eq_24()` for nonce comparisons.
- **Decoy Database Generator**: `generate_decoy_data(config)` produces plausible fake contacts, messages, and `.onion` addresses for Duress PIN scenarios.
- **Stealth Mode Spec**: `StealthModeSpec` for hiding app icon after duress (Android launcher alias toggle).
- **Protocol Spec v2.0**: Full threat model (8 adversary types), security properties table, out-of-order handling, cover traffic, configurable sizes.
- **Nix Reproducible Builds Guide**: `docs/nix-reproducible.md` with planned flake.nix for F-Droid-grade reproducibility.
- **Post-Compromise Security Tests**: Test vectors verifying that KEM ratchet invalidates old keys.
- **Forward Secrecy Tests**: Test vectors verifying old message keys are irrecoverable.

#### Security Hardening v1 (2026-02-24)
- **Post-Quantum Double Ratchet** (`crypto/pq_ratchet.rs`): `PQRatchetState` with hybrid X25519+ML-KEM-1024 initialization, symmetric chain ratchet, and KEM rekey steps for post-compromise security.
- **Traffic Analysis Resistance** (`network/padding.rs`): Fixed 4096-byte packet size, random padding, `pad_to_fixed_size()` / `strip_padding()`, random 200-800ms delays.
- **Constant-Time Comparisons** (`crypto/constant_time.rs`): `eq_32()`, `eq_64()`, `eq_slices()` using `subtle::ConstantTimeEq`.
- **Memory Hardening**: Message keys zeroized immediately after use. `clear_all_pending_ratchets_for_duress()` for Duress PIN.
- **Plausible Deniability** (`storage/mod.rs`): `DeniableStorage` trait, `DuressPinSpec`, `on_duress_pin_entered()` core entry point.
- **Duress PIN JNI** (`ffi/android.rs`): `RustBridge.onDuressPinEntered()` for Android.
- **Reproducible Builds**: `Dockerfile.core` (multi-stage, pinned Rust 1.83), `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (cargo-audit, cargo-deny, SHA256), `deny.toml`.
- **Tor Migration Docs**: `docs/arti-migration.md` for C Tor to Arti transition.
- **Protocol Spec v1.0**: `docs/protocol.md` covering onion identity, key agreement, ratchet, padding, message types, Ping-Pong, deniability, invariants.

### Fixed

#### Ghost Ping/Message Issue - ACK Listener JNI Binding
- **RustBridge.kt (line 375)**: Fixed startAckListener() JNI binding crash
  - Removed default parameter from external function declaration
  - Changed from `external fun startAckListener(port: Int = 9153)` to `external fun startAckListener(port: Int)`
  - JNI does not support Kotlin default parameters, causing UnsatisfiedLinkError
  - ACK listener now starts successfully on port 9153
  - PING_ACK and MESSAGE_ACK delivery now functional
  - Eliminates ghost pings caused by sender retries when ACKs fail to send
  - Root cause: sender never received ACK, assumed message failed, sent new ping with different ID
  - Each retry ping was legitimate (unique ID), so deduplication correctly allowed it

#### Database-Based Message Deduplication
- **database/entities/ReceivedId.kt**: Created entity for tracking all received ping/pong/message IDs
  - UNIQUE constraint on receivedId field for atomic deduplication
  - Tracks ID type (PING, PONG, MESSAGE) and timestamp
  - Prevents race conditions where same ID arrives before database insert completes

- **database/dao/ReceivedIdDao.kt**: Created DAO for deduplication operations
  - insertReceivedId() with OnConflictStrategy.IGNORE returns -1 for duplicates
  - Atomic INSERT operation using UNIQUE constraint prevents race conditions
  - exists() method for checking if ID was previously received
  - deleteOldIds() for cleanup of IDs older than 30 days

- **ShieldMessengerDatabase.kt (lines 34-35, 185-202)**: Added migration 10 to 11
  - Creates received_ids table with UNIQUE index on receivedId
  - Migration creates table and index for deduplication tracking
  - Database version bumped to 11

- **TorService.kt (lines 869-882, 936-962, 1189-1222)**: Implemented PRIMARY deduplication layer
  - Ping deduplication: Tracks each ping ID before processing
  - Pong deduplication: Tracks with "pong_" prefix before message send
  - Message blob deduplication: Uses encrypted payload hash as ID
  - All checks happen BEFORE notifications or database saves
  - Returns -1L from insertReceivedId() indicates duplicate, skips processing
  - Sends ACK for duplicates to stop sender retries

- **TorService.kt (lines 1214-1215, 1689-1690)**: Removed secondary duplicate checks
  - Deleted messageExists() check for blob messages
  - Deleted getMessageByMessageId() check for regular messages
  - Secondary checks were blocking rapid identical messages like "yo" "yo" "yo"
  - PRIMARY ReceivedId table deduplication is sufficient
  - Allows users to send same text multiple times quickly

- **TorService.kt (lines 1098-1101)**: Fixed blob message ID generation
  - Changed from content+timestamp hash to encrypted payload hash
  - Uses hash of encrypted bytes (includes random nonce)
  - Allows rapid messages with same text (each encryption produces different hash)
  - Blocks true network duplicates (same encrypted blob)

#### Bridge Configuration Persistence
- **TorManager.kt (lines 92-130)**: Fixed bridge configuration not applied on restart
  - Torrc file now ALWAYS written before Tor starts (even if already running)
  - Previously only wrote torrc if Tor wasn't running, causing race condition
  - Bridge configuration changes now persist across Tor restarts
  - Moved torrc write outside the "if not running" check

- **BridgeActivity.kt (line 117)**: Increased restart delay for clean shutdown
  - Changed delay from 2000ms to 3500ms
  - Ensures Tor fully stops before new configuration applied
  - Prevents race condition where new Tor starts before old one fully stopped

#### Notification Behavior
- **TorService.kt (lines 2050-2063)**: Minimized connected state notification
  - Changed to PRIORITY_MIN for normal "Connected" state (just icon in status bar)
  - Empty title and text when connected (completely silent)
  - PRIORITY_DEFAULT only for problem states (Connecting, Failed, Retrying)
  - Added setShowWhen(false) and setSilent(true) for connected state
  - Prevents swipeable notification entirely when working correctly
  - Users only see notification text when there's an issue requiring attention

### Added

#### Auto-Lock Timer Security Feature
- **AutoLockActivity.kt**: Created activity for configuring auto-lock timeout
  - Timer options: 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, Never
  - Saves selection to SharedPreferences "security" with key "auto_lock_timeout_ms"
  - Companion object defines timeout constants
  - Shows confirmation toast with selected timeout
  - Automatically closes after selection with 500ms delay

- **activity_auto_lock.xml**: Created layout for auto-lock timer selection
  - RadioGroup with 6 options for different timeout intervals
  - Dark themed with settings_item_bg background
  - Warning color for "Never" option (not recommended)
  - Info text explaining auto-lock behavior

- **BaseActivity.kt**: Implemented auto-lock timer logic
  - Tracks app lifecycle with onPause() and onResume()
  - Records timestamp when app goes to background
  - Checks elapsed time when app returns to foreground
  - Locks app by navigating to LockActivity if timeout exceeded
  - Skips auto-lock for LockActivity, CreateAccountActivity, SplashActivity
  - Respects "Never" timeout setting (TIMEOUT_NEVER = -1L)
  - Uses separate SharedPreferences for lifecycle tracking

- **MainActivity.kt, ChatActivity.kt, AddFriendActivity.kt, SecurityModeActivity.kt**: Extended BaseActivity
  - Auto-lock timer now functional on all main app screens
  - Consistent security behavior across messaging, contacts, and settings

- **SecurityModeActivity.kt (lines 29-45)**: Added auto-lock settings integration
  - setupAutoLock() launches AutoLockActivity when item clicked
  - updateAutoLockStatus() displays current timeout selection
  - Updates status text in onResume() to reflect changes

- **activity_security_mode.xml**: Added App Security section
  - Auto-Lock Timer item shows current timeout
  - Tappable item navigates to AutoLockActivity
  - Arrow indicator for navigation

- **activity_settings.xml (lines 176-219)**: Added Advanced Security menu item
  - "Advanced Security" entry in Settings
  - Description: "Auto-lock timer, connection settings"
  - Navigates to SecurityModeActivity

#### Enhanced Deduplication Diagnostics
- **TorService.kt (lines 936-962)**: Added detailed logging for ping deduplication
  - Logs "DEDUPLICATION CHECK: Ping ID = X" for every ping
  - Logs "Attempting to insert Ping ID into received_ids table..."
  - Logs insert result with rowId (NEW or DUPLICATE status)
  - Try-catch block logs database exceptions with full details
  - Logs "NEW PING ACCEPTED" or "DUPLICATE PING BLOCKED" based on result
  - Helps diagnose deduplication failures and database issues

### Changed

#### Security UI Simplification
- **activity_security_mode.xml**: Removed non-configurable security features
  - Removed "Direct Ping-Pong" toggle (core feature, cannot be disabled)
  - Removed "Tor Connection" toggle (core feature, cannot be disabled)
  - Removed "About Direct Ping-Pong" info box
  - Advanced Security page now shows only Auto-Lock Timer
  - Cleaner interface focused on user-configurable security settings

- **SecurityModeActivity.kt**: Removed tor toggle setup
  - Removed setupTorToggle() method
  - Removed SwitchCompat import
  - Removed ThemedToast import
  - Simplified onCreate() to only setup auto-lock and bottom navigation

### Technical Details

#### Auto-Lock Timer Operation
- Records System.currentTimeMillis() in onPause() to SharedPreferences
- Calculates elapsed time in onResume() by subtracting stored timestamp from current time
- Compares elapsed time against configured timeout from "security" preferences
- Timeout values range from 30,000ms (30s) to 1,800,000ms (30m), or -1L for Never
- Navigates to LockActivity with FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK and FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK
- Uses separate "app_lifecycle" preferences to avoid conflicts with security settings

#### Database Migration 10 to 11
- Creates received_ids table with columns: id (autoincrement), receivedId (text), idType (text), receivedTimestamp (integer), processed (boolean)
- Creates UNIQUE INDEX on receivedId column for atomic duplicate detection
- Migration SQL uses "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS" for safety
- Index creation uses "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS"
- Room handles migration automatically on first app launch after upgrade

#### Deduplication Flow
1. Receive ping/pong/message from network
2. Create ReceivedId entity with unique ID and type
3. Call database.receivedIdDao().insertReceivedId() in runBlocking coroutine
4. If rowId == -1L, ID already exists (duplicate), return early
5. If rowId > 0, ID is new, continue processing (show notification, save message, etc)
6. Send ACK to sender to confirm receipt
7. Duplicate arrives later, step 4 catches it, ACK sent but no processing

#### ACK Listener Architecture
- Listener runs on port 9153 (separate from message listener on 9150)
- Accepts incoming ACK messages (PING_ACK, MESSAGE_ACK) from contacts
- Rust TorManager binds TCP socket to localhost:9153 via Tor hidden service
- ACKs encrypted with shared secret (ECDH using X25519 keys)
- Wire format: [Type Byte 0x06][Sender X25519 Public Key][Encrypted ACK]
- JNI function Java_com_shieldmessenger_crypto_RustBridge_startAckListener must match exactly
- Default parameters in Kotlin external fun break JNI name mangling

  - Added setForegroundServiceBehavior(FOREGROUND_SERVICE_IMMEDIATE) for Android 12+
  - Prevents service termination when user swipes notification
  - Ensures continuous operation for 24/7 message reception
  - Notification now truly non-dismissible as required for foreground services

#### Bridge Configuration
- **BridgeActivity.kt (lines 102-119)**: Implemented automatic Tor restart on bridge save
  - Added TorService stop/restart sequence when bridge configuration changes
  - Stops existing Tor connection before applying new bridge
  - Waits 2 seconds for clean shutdown before restart

### Added

#### Boot Receiver for Background Operation
- **receivers/BootReceiver.kt**: Created boot receiver for automatic service startup
  - Listens for BOOT_COMPLETED, QUICKBOOT_POWERON, and LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED intents
  - Automatically starts TorService when device boots
  - Schedules MessageRetryWorker for background message processing
  - Only activates if user account is initialized (respects app state)
  - Enables message reception without user opening app

- **AndroidManifest.xml (line 27)**: Added RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED permission
  - Required for boot receiver functionality
  - Standard Android permission, granted automatically

- **AndroidManifest.xml (lines 210-220)**: Registered BootReceiver component
  - Set as exported for system broadcasts
  - Enabled directBootAware for early boot support
  - Configured intent filters for multiple boot scenarios (standard, quick boot, locked boot)

#### Enhanced Background Message Processing
- **TorService.kt (lines 360-362, 401-403)**: Added MessageRetryWorker scheduling in TorService
  - Schedules worker when Tor initializes successfully
  - Schedules worker when Tor is already running (service restart case)
  - Ensures retry worker always active when service runs
  - Provides redundant scheduling for reliability

### Changed

#### Message ID Generation Strategy
- Ping-based messages: Deterministic ID format "msg_$pingId"
- Blob messages: Deterministic hash "blob_" + Base64(SHA256(senderId:content:timestamp))
- Ensures same message generates same ID for deduplication
- Maintains uniqueness across different messages

#### Retry Backoff Schedule
- Initial delay: 5 seconds
- Backoff multiplier: 2.0x per retry
- Maximum delay: 5 minutes (capped)
- Full schedule: 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 300s (capped at 5min)

#### MessageRetryWorker Scheduling Redundancy
Now scheduled in three independent locations for maximum reliability:
1. MainActivity - when app opens
2. TorService - when Tor connects (both fresh init and already-running cases)
3. BootReceiver - when device boots

#### Delivery Tracking Flags
- pingDelivered: Set to true when PING_ACK received from recipient
- messageDelivered: Set to true when MESSAGE_ACK received from recipient
- Both flags checked before retry attempts to prevent unnecessary retransmissions
- Flags persist in database for reliability across app restarts

### Technical Details

#### Boot Process Flow
1. Device boots and system broadcasts BOOT_COMPLETED
2. BootReceiver verifies account is initialized
3. BootReceiver starts TorService as foreground service
4. BootReceiver schedules MessageRetryWorker
5. TorService connects to Tor network
6. TorService starts hidden service listener
7. MessageRetryWorker begins polling every 5 minutes
8. User can receive messages without opening app

#### MessageRetryWorker Operation
- Interval: Every 5 minutes
- Network requirement: Connected network state
- Operations per cycle:
  1. Poll for received Pongs and send queued message payloads
  2. Retry pending Pings using exponential backoff
  3. Update retry counters and timestamps in database
- Respects delivery flags to prevent duplicate sends
- Logs all operations for debugging

#### Security Considerations
- StrongBox provides hardware isolation on supported devices (Pixel, some flagships)
- TEE fallback still provides hardware-backed security on all devices
- Both implementations use Android Keystore for key protection
- Biometric key never leaves secure hardware
- Password hash encrypted with biometric-protected key

#### Performance Impact
- Boot receiver: Negligible (<100ms execution time)
- MessageRetryWorker: Low CPU usage, runs max 5 minutes per hour
- Deterministic message IDs: No performance impact, same hash computation
- Deduplication checks: Fast database queries using indexed messageId field

  - WAL mode disabled for maximum security (DELETE journal mode)
  - Database passphrase derived using SHA-256(seed + salt)

- **Contact Management UI**
  - Contacts now load from encrypted database in MainActivity
  - Custom dark-themed contact list item layout
  - Contacts displayed with name and truncated Solana address
  - Contact options screen with rounded corner info box
  - Delete contact functionality with confirmation dialog
  - Contact deletion removes from encrypted database
  - Automatic navigation back to main screen after deletion

### Changed
- **Contact List Display**
  - Replaced hardcoded sample contacts with real database queries
  - ContactAdapter now uses custom item_contact.xml layout
  - Dark card background (#151B26) matching app theme

  - Delete button styled with subtle border and gray text

### Fixed
- **SQLCipher PRAGMA Errors**
  - Fixed "Queries cannot be performed using execSQL()" error
  - Changed both secure_delete and journal_mode to use query() instead of execSQL()
  - SQLCipher requires query() method even for PRAGMAs that don't return meaningful results

- **Contact Display Issues**
  - Fixed ContactAdapter not showing contact text
  - Added proper TextView binding in ViewHolder
  - Contacts now display correctly in RecyclerView

### Technical Details

- app/src/main/java/com/shieldmessenger/database/entities/Contact.kt - Contact entity
- app/src/main/java/com/shieldmessenger/database/entities/Message.kt - Message entity
- app/src/main/java/com/shieldmessenger/database/dao/ContactDao.kt - Contact DAO with queries
- app/src/main/java/com/shieldmessenger/database/dao/MessageDao.kt - Message DAO with delivery tracking
- app/src/main/res/drawable/contact_info_box_bg.xml - Rounded corner background
- app/src/main/res/drawable/delete_button_bg.xml - Delete button styling

**Dependencies Added:**
- androidx.room:room-runtime:2.6.1 - Room database ORM
- androidx.room:room-ktx:2.6.1 - Kotlin coroutines support
- net.zetetic:android-database-sqlcipher:4.5.4 - SQLCipher encryption
- androidx.sqlite:sqlite:2.4.0 - SQLite support library

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  displayName TEXT NOT NULL,
  solanaAddress TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  publicKeyBase64 TEXT NOT NULL,
  torOnionAddress TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  addedTimestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
  lastContactTimestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
  trustLevel INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  notes TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE messages (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  contactId INTEGER NOT NULL,
  messageId TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  encryptedContent BLOB NOT NULL,
  timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
  isOutgoing INTEGER NOT NULL,
  deliveryStatus TEXT NOT NULL,
  readTimestamp INTEGER,
  senderSignature BLOB,
  FOREIGN KEY (contactId) REFERENCES contacts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Database file stored at /data/data/com.shieldmessenger/databases/shield_messenger.db
- No plaintext data ever touches disk
- Encryption key never stored, derived fresh from BIP39 seed on each session
- Database verification method confirms encryption is active
- Secure deletion ensures deleted data cannot be recovered

**Testing:**
- Contact successfully saved to encrypted database (ID: 1)
- Contact loaded and displayed in MainActivity contacts tab
- Contact deletion removes from database and updates UI
- Database encryption verified (cannot open without passphrase)
- PRAGMA statements execute correctly with SQLCipher

## [0.1.1] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed
- **App crash on x86_64 emulators** - Built and packaged Rust native library for x86_64 architecture alongside existing ARM64 build. The app was crashing on Android emulators with `dlopen failed: library "libshieldmessenger.so" not found` error.
- **Tor reconnection on every app launch** - Fixed SplashActivity redundantly re-initializing Tor every time the app opened. Now properly checks if Tor is already initialized and reuses existing connection, preventing 15-30 second bootstrap delays.
- **Memory leak warning in KeyManager** - Fixed singleton pattern to use applicationContext instead of Activity context to prevent memory leaks. Added proper `@Suppress("StaticFieldLeak")` annotation with safety justification.
- **Back navigation in account creation** - Fixed issue where pressing back button in CreateAccountActivity or RestoreAccountActivity would close the app. Now properly returns to lock screen.

### Added
- **Production cryptography integration** - Integrated real cryptographic libraries (LazySodium for Ed25519/X25519, web3j for BIP39, BouncyCastle) into KeyManager. Replaced all placeholder crypto implementations.
- **Wallet UI integration** - Connected wallet-related activities to KeyManager:
  - SplashActivity now checks wallet initialization status on startup
  - CreateAccountActivity generates real BIP39 12-word mnemonics and derives Solana addresses
  - WalletIdentityActivity displays actual wallet address from KeyManager
- **Multi-architecture native library support** - Added x86_64 native library build to jniLibs alongside ARM64, enabling app to run on both physical devices and emulators.
- **Proper authentication flow** - Implemented lock screen that appears after Tor connection. Shows password entry for existing wallets, or account creation/import options for new users. Prevents unauthorized access to the app.

### Changed
- **Code quality improvements** - Fixed all IDE warnings:
  - Removed unused imports
  - Changed to use Kotlin KTX extensions (`SharedPreferences.edit { }`)
  - Implemented proper equals/hashCode for KeyPair data class with ByteArray properties
  - Added `@Suppress("unused")` annotations to JNI-called methods with explanatory comments
- **Improved Tor persistence** - Modified `SplashActivity.testTorInitialization()` to `checkTorStatus()` which verifies existing connection instead of creating new one. TorService remains the single source of Tor initialization.
- **SplashActivity navigation** - Now always navigates to LockActivity after Tor connects, instead of directly to MainActivity or CreateAccountActivity. Ensures proper authentication on every app launch.
- **Account creation flow** - After successfully creating or restoring an account, the app now clears the back stack and navigates directly to MainActivity, preventing accidental return to account setup screens.

  - Service type set to `dataSync` for appropriate foreground service permissions
  - Notification channel configured with low importance to minimize user interruption
  - START_STICKY return value ensures Android restarts service if killed

- **TorManager Rust Implementation** (shield-messenger-core/src/network/tor.rs)
  - Enhanced `create_hidden_service()` with configurable service and local ports
  - Added port configuration fields: `hs_service_port` and `hs_local_port`

  - Tor bootstrap now completes in background while foreground notification shows
  - Service starts in <100ms, well under Android's 20-second timeout
  - No more "Service not responding" dialogs

- **Multiple App Instances Issue**
  - Resolved duplicate task creation by implementing singleTask launch mode
  - Fixed recents menu showing 3-4 ShieldMessenger entries during testing
  - Now only one instance appears regardless of how many times app is launched
  - Existing task is brought to front instead of creating new one

- **Service Persistence After App Closure**
  - Verified TorService continues running after app is swiped away from recents
  - Confirmed WakeLock keeps CPU active for background socket operations
  - Tested foreground notification persists correctly in notification shade
  - Service process remains alive as verified by `ps` command
  - Ping poller thread continues monitoring for incoming connections
