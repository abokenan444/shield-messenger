Shield Messenger — Privacy-First Encrypted Communication

Shield Messenger is an open-source, end-to-end encrypted messaging app that routes ALL traffic through the Tor network. No phone number. No email. No metadata. Just private communication.

CORE FEATURES:

• End-to-End Encryption — Every message, call, and file is encrypted using a post-quantum Double Ratchet protocol (X25519 + ML-KEM-768 hybrid).

• Tor-Only Networking — All communication travels through Tor hidden services (.onion). Your IP address is never exposed. No central server sees your messages.

• Encrypted Voice Calls — Make voice calls over Tor with Opus codec and adaptive jitter buffering. Latency-optimized for real-time conversation.

• Zero Metadata — No phone number or email required to register. Your identity is a cryptographic keypair, not a phone number.

• Plausible Deniability — Duress PIN feature: enter a special PIN under coercion to silently wipe sensitive data while showing a decoy profile.

• Shielded Payments — Send and receive Zcash (ZEC) using shielded (Sapling) addresses directly within conversations.

• Safety Numbers — Verify your contacts' identity keys using numeric safety numbers or QR codes, just like Signal.

• Self-Destructing Messages — Set messages to auto-delete after a chosen time period.

• Open Source — Fully auditable code. The cryptographic core is written in Rust for memory safety.

PRIVACY BY DESIGN:

Shield Messenger collects zero user data. There are no analytics, no tracking, no ads, and no telemetry. The app cannot read your messages — only you and your intended recipient can.

Your encryption keys never leave your device. If you lose your device, your messages are gone forever (unless you back up your seed phrase).

BUILT FOR ACTIVISTS, JOURNALISTS, AND ANYONE WHO VALUES PRIVACY.

Shield Messenger is designed for people living under surveillance, journalists protecting sources, activists organizing safely, and anyone who believes private communication is a human right.
