/**
 * Persistent ping inbox for tracking message delivery state
 *
 * State machine (existing states unchanged, new states added above max):
 *
 * Manual path: PING_SEEN (0) → PONG_SENT (1) → MSG_STORED (2)
 * Auto path: PING_SEEN (0) → DOWNLOAD_QUEUED (10) → PONG_SENT (1) → MSG_STORED (2)
 * Auto failure: DOWNLOAD_QUEUED (10) → FAILED_TEMP (11) → DOWNLOAD_QUEUED (10) [retry]
 * FAILED_TEMP (11) → MANUAL_REQUIRED (12) [retries exhausted, show lock icon]
 * MANUAL_REQUIRED (12) → DOWNLOAD_QUEUED (10) [user tapped lock]
 *
 * Watchdog: DOWNLOAD_QUEUED older than 5 min → FAILED_TEMP (process died)
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Survives app restarts (no SharedPreferences state)
 * - Prevents duplicate notifications via atomic claims
 * - Prevents ghost lock icons via DB-driven UI
 * - Separates PING_ACK ("I saw it") from MESSAGE_ACK ("I stored it")
 * - Single source of truth for all download/indicator state
