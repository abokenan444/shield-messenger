/**
 * ContactKeyChain entity for progressive ephemeral key evolution
 *
 * Stores per-contact key chain state for messaging encryption with forward secrecy.
 * Keys are evolved forward using HMAC-SHA256 after each message, providing:
 * - Per-message forward secrecy (old messages stay secure if current key compromised)
 * - Post-compromise recovery (future messages become secure after compromise ends)
 * - Automatic key erasure (old chain keys cannot be recovered from new ones)
 *
 * Stored in encrypted SQLCipher database (AES-256).
